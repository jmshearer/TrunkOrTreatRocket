# Truck-Or-Treat Rocket Launch
As seen at [Annville Church of the Brethren](https://www.annvillecob.org) Trunk or Treat in 2022.

## Features

- Flame effect (Arduino Uno + addressible LEDs)
- Fog machine
- Countdown timer with sound effects (written in VB.net)
- USB relays tying everything together

Please feel free to puruse the repo.   It's doubtful that you would want to recreate the project in its entirety, but there are probably some useful pieces for other projects.
